### Notes

- The genesis block can be found at `database/genesis.json`
- To modify the network difficulty, modify the `IsBlockHashValid` function in `database/state.go`

## Tests

Run all tests with verbosity but one at a time (without timeout as mining takes time), to avoid ports collisions:

```
go test -v -p=1 -timeout=0 ./...
```

Run an individual test:

```
go test -timeout=0 ./node -test.v -test.run ^TestNode_Mining$
```

Note: Majority are integration tests and will take time to run, due to mining. Some accounts have been added to the repository as test accounts.
